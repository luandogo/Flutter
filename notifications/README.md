A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

## Firebase 

It is necessary to change all the files where you can find  "com.example.project_name" to "com.UNIQUE_NAME_HERE.project_name".

You need to create a project in Firebase.
Register the app with your new package name "com.UNIQUE_NAME_HERE.project_name" and in the SHA1 part you need to run in the terminal cd android && ./gradlew signingReport to get the SHA1.
